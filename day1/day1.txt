* computer vision focusses on replicating parts of complexity of human vision syste.
* It is used to identify and process objects in images and videos in the same way that humans do.
* Lots of images are needed to train a model of computer  vision.
* Computers usually read color as a series of 3 values - RGB
* The primary deep learning library used is Keras.
* TensorFlow and Theano are libraries for defining abstract, general-purpose computation graphs.
* Keras, on the other hand, is a deep learning framework that provides a well-designed API to facilitate building deep neural networks with ease.
* we onlu use OpenCV to facilitate basic image processing operations sucha as loading an image from disk, displaying it to ojur screen.
