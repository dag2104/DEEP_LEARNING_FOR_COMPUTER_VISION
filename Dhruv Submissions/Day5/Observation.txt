In this, I have observed, that firstly we created a pseudo data and then we have tried to minimise the loss by iterating the same data through the classifier until the desired number of epochs has been met.  

Also after every iteration, we kept on updating weight matrix.

Now as our classifier is trained, now we will evaluate it, a classification report is printed on the terminal of our machine. 

Now, to make predictions using our weight matrix W, we have used predict method on testX and W.

And finally, we are plotting graphs of our testing data and loss over time using matplotlib.
