# DEEP_LEARNING_FOR_COMPUTER_VISION
I’m sort of moody and a bit of an introvert. I mean, I’m always the wallflower. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like being around people. I actually love it. 
I thrive on deep conversations where I feel a strong connection with someone. And I’d like to think I’m a good listener and a good conversationalist.

Currentlty i am studing in NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, HAMIRPUR under UG program in ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING.\
I aquire some skill in c language and also, I have a good technical knowledge of boards like ARUINO and esp8266.

Since the begining of the college i was a little bit interested in exploring all my fields of interested , i mean knowing how different things work .
That's why i have a none eperience in any project and niether i was interested in any of my options.    

Thats all i have for ME till present .
